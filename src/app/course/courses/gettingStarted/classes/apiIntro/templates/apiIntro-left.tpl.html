    <h1>RESTful API Intro</h1>
    <h2>What is a RESTful API?</h2>
    <p>
        A RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API is an increasingly popular software architecture that
        enables scalable, maintainable, and performant web services. A RESTful API exposes its
        underlying data model the same way your browser makes a request to a server to receive a web page,
        through the HTTP protocol. What this means is that, 1. You don't have to incorporate any additional
        technology to process your requests, and 2. It's a lot easier! Additionally, RESTful API allows
        the client to interact with it in the form of standard data objects and markup (XML, JSON, HTML),
        which are conceptually different than the representations of the data stored on the server. This means
        you don't have to worry about dealing with advanced data manipulation or conversions to send and
        receive data, so you can focus on building applications.

    </p>
    <h2>What makes a RESTful API "RESTful?"</h2>
    <p>
        There are a few key factors that make a RESTful API "RESTful",
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Client-Server Separation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This means the client never has to inherently concern itself with data storage, that's all handled
            on the server side through the API</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Stateless</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A RESTful API never concerns itself with the state of the client, and every request from the client
            contains everything necessary to handle the request</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cacheable</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A RESTful API will in some way state that it is cacheable or not, ensuring that data isn't stale or
            misused in your application</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Layered System</li>
        <li>Code on demand (optional)</li>
        <li>Uniform Interface</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A Uniform Interface ensures that you will never have to worry about the API fundamentally changing
            the way in which it works, meaning you can be rest assured that your app won't one day crash because
            of an API update</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h2>RESTful API Methods</h2>
    <p>
        Every RESTful API has a standard set of Methods that allow you to interact with the data model.
        They all serve a different purpose, but together offer an exhaustive tool-set to interact with the
        data model. The Methods used on OrderCloud 3.0 are,
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><code>GET</code></li>
        <li><code>POST</code></li>
        <li><code>PUT</code></li>
        <li><code>PATCH</code></li>
        <li><code>DELETE</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <code>GET</code> is one of the most commonly used Methods, and allows you to do exactly as the name
        suggests. <code>GET</code> is what you will use to access any data objects that are already stored on the
        server. This Method is read-only, meaning you will only be able to access information stored on the
        server, never manipulate it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>POST</code> is also a very commonly used Method in OrderCloud 3.0, and allows you to send new
        objects to be created and stored on the server. With a <code>POST</code> Method call, you must also send an object
        as part of the request, like so,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 85px;" class="readonly-box" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'idle_fingers',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="apiIntro.leftScript1"></div>
    <p>
        which is where the content of your call will be located.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>PUT</code> is a utility method in RESTful API's. It allows you to create OR update an object stored on
        the server. With a <code>PUT</code> method call, you must also send an object in the request. If the ID of
        the object is not found on the server, a new object will be created with that ID. If the ID of the object
        is found, a <code>PUT</code> method will update the object with the new object you send in the request.
        Note that if you are using <code>PUT</code> to update a pre-existing object, you must send a full object
        in your request. This means you cannot send it an object with only the updates you wish to make.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>PATCH</code> is similar to a <code>PUT</code> in that it updates a pre-existing object already stored
        on the server. The difference is that with a <code>PATCH</code> method call, you only have to send the changes
        in the request object vs. the entire object. This works great for when you are only updating a small piece of
        the object you are targeting.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>DELETE</code> will remove an entire object from server. You will not have to send an object with a
        <code>DELETE</code> method call, as the information of the target object you are attempting to delete
        will either be in the parameters, or in the URL params.
    </p>
    <h2>OrderCloud 3.0 Console</h2>
    <p>
        To the right, you will see three different containers. The large container on the left is the OrderCloud 3.0
        Console. This is a fully function HTTP protocol-based console for you to send real API requests, much like
        you would see in Google's PostMan API Console or Fiddler.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the bottom right corner, you will see your response console. This is where any response data from your
        API request will end up, and will also be the first place you'll want to look if you run into any errors,
        as the API has robust error messaging functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        And finally, in the upper right hand corner, we have provided you with a section for helpful hints to make your
        life a little bit easier when it comes to processing your API requests, focusing on whatever class you are
        currently taking.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have provided you with an example request in the console that will give you a taste of what the console
        will look and feel like as you move on through the tutorials. Go ahead and review the Method, URL, and
        Parameters at the top of the OrderCloud 3.0 Console. The Method, Location, and Content-Type/Authorization
        Params will be a part of every request you make. When you are ready, go ahead and click submit, and you will
        see a sample response in the response console.
    </p>
    <p>
        The OrderCloud 3.0 Console will be available to you in every class you take. You have the option to pre-fill
        the method, url, and paramaters in every course (change the settings in the upper right hand corner of the
        console container). From now on (after this page), you will be able to make any request you want, in any course, at any time.
    </p>
