    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        Getting Authenticated is the first step in working with the OrderCloud 3.0 API. Before getting authenticated,
        you need to make sure you have an Administrative (distributor) clientID, which you should have been provided
        when registering your account with Four51. In these tutorials, you will be using two different clientID's.
        The first will be your Admin ClientID with a username and password you have already created.
        The second will be a Buyer ClientID with a Username and Password of a mock User that
        you will create specifically for the tutorials. For now, we'll focus on authenticating and using your
        admin user. In the following steps, we will walk you through authenticating your admin user
        through the API Console, which will give you a more proper understanding of how your applications are
        authenticating your users, so you have a better idea of how authentication works with the OrderCloud
        3.0 API.
    </p>
    <h2>Authenticating your Admin User</h2>
    <p>
        In order to do anything with the OrderCloud 3.0 API, you need to authenticate your Admin User.
        To accomplish this, you will need your Admin (Distributor) ClientID, your Admin Username, and
        your Admin Password. You should already have this information, but if you do not, reach out to your
        contact at <a href>Four51 Support</a> and ask them if they can provide you with your Admin ClientID.
        If you need to reset your Admin Username or password, you can do that <a href>here</a>.
        Please make sure you have this information before continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are now ready to authenticate your Admin User and start your journey building applications on the
        OrderCloud 3.0 Platform. Take a look at the OrderCloud 3.0 Console to the right. You will notice that
        there are no headers or parameters, and the Location URL prefix is slightly different than the one
        you saw in the "RESTful API Intro" class, that looked like this,
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://<em>api</em>.ordercloud.io/...</code></pre>
    <p class="tabless">
        Authentication will always require you to send your auth request to a separate location,
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://<em>auth</em>.ordercloud.io/...</code></pre>
    <p>
        Additionally, the data type you will be working with in authentication is different than the JSON objects
        you'll be using in the API. You will instead be working with a string. Down below you will see the basic
        structure of the string you will be sending in your auth request,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 85px;" class="readonly-box" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'idle_fingers',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="course.class.leftScripts[0]"></div>
    <p class="tabless">
        It is made up of five separate chunks. The first is your ClientID (formatted, 'client_id'),
        which you should already have with you. The second is the grant_type, which you will set to 'password' and
        is telling the system what type of credentials you will be using to authenticate your user. The third
        and fourth are your username and password, which doesn't need explaining. And the fifth is the scope, which you
        will set to 'FullAccess' (This may change based on your circumstances beyond this course).
        Feel free to grab the request body template above, and drop it into the OrderCloud 3.0
        Console to the right. Fill in the client_id, username, and password with yours, and press submit.
    </p>
    <p ng-show="course.class.apiCallSuccess">
        Great Job! You now officially have an authenticated user. The 'access_token' that came back in the response
        object has also been stored in your cookies, and can be auto-filled into your 'Authorization' Header in
        your OrderCloud 3.0 Console settings (look in the upper right hand corner of the OrderCloud 3.0 Console for
        the dropdown)
