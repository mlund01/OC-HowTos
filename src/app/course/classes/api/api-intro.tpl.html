    <h2>What is a RESTful API?</h2>
    <p>
        A RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API is an increasingly popular software architecture that
        enables scalable, maintainable, and performant web services. A RESTful API exposes its
        underlying data model the same way your browser makes a request to a server to receive a web page,
        through the HTTP protocol. What this means is that, 1. You don't have to incorporate any additional
        technology to process your requests, and 2. It's a lot easier! Additionally, RESTful API allows
        the client to interact with it in the form of standard data objects and markup (XML, JSON, HTML),
        which are conceptually different than the representations of the data stored on the server. This means
        you don't have to worry about dealing with advanced data manipulation or conversions to send and
        receive data, so you can focus on building applications.

    </p>
    <h2>What makes a RESTful API "RESTful?"</h2>
    <p>
        There are a few key factors that make a RESTful API "RESTful",
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Client-Server Separation</li>
        <ul>
            This means the client never has to inherently concern itself with data storage, that's all handled
            on the server side through the API
        </ul>
        <li>Stateless</li>
        <ul>
            A RESTful API never concerns itself with the state of the client, and every request from the client
            contains everything necessary to handle the request
        </ul>
        <li>Cacheable</li>
        <ul>
            A RESTful API will in some way state that it is cacheable or not, ensuring that data isn't stale or
            misused in your application
        </ul>
        <li>Layered System</li>
        <li>Code on demand (optional)</li>
        <li>Uniform Interface</li>
        <ul>
            A Uniform Interface ensures that you will never have to worry about the API fundamentally changing
            the way in which it works, meaning you can be rest assured that your app won't one day crash because
            of an API update
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h2>Making a RESTful API Request</h2>
    <p>
        Every RESTful API Request has a few key components that are required to successfully make a request
        to the server to retreive the information you are looking for. First, every request has a Method. A
        method is what tells the server what kind of action you are trying to make, whether it be Creating, Retrieving,
        Updating, or Deleting an object (commonly referred to as CRUD operations). We'll go into more depth down
        below about how the OrderCloud 3.0 RESTful API uses Methods to accomplish CRUD operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second component of a RESTful API Request is a URL. The URL is what your API Request will use to understand
        where it should be sending itself to fulfill its obligations. Every URL request has as base URL and a routing
        URL, where the base URL informs the request of the location of the server it is targeting, and the routing
        URL will tell the server what the request is targeting, so the server knows how to handle it. The OrderCloud 3.0
        base url is,
    </p>
        <pre><code>https:/api.ordercloud.io</code></pre>
    <p>
        An example of an OrderCloud 3.0 Routing URL is,
    </p>
    <pre><code>/v1/buyers/{buyerID}/users</code></pre>
    <p>
        where 'v1' is the version of the API, 'buyers' is telling the API that
        it's going to be targeting the buyers peice of the API, '{buyerID}' is the specific buyer it is targeting, and
        'users' is telling the server that it is targeting users underneath the buyer specified before it. Notice how the
        routing URL accepts a parameter for 'buyerID'. We'll get deeper into how parameters are included down below,
        but keep in mind that a parameter can be included in the routing URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third component of a RESTful API Request is Headers. Headers are synonymous with 'Meta Information',
        meaning they provide additional descriptive but necessary information about the request that the
        server will need to process the request. Two Headers that you will send in every request you make
        to the OrderCloud 3.0 RESTful API are 'Content-Type' and 'Authorization'. 'Content-Type' tells the server
        what type of object-format you are sending and what kind of object-format you want back. 'Authorization'
        will include a token that let's the server know that whoever is sending the request to the server is
        authenticated and should be trusted. In these tutorials, we will be using a 'Content-Type' of
        'application/json'. You will learn more about your 'Authorization' token in the next class.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fourth component of a RESTful API Request is Parameters. Parameters are not necessarily a part of every
        request, because not every request requires a parameter. An easy example of this in OrderCloud 3.0 is when
        you want to GET a list of all buyers under your distributor. The Request would be,
    </p>
    <pre><code>GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers</code></pre>
    <p>
        which would also be sent with the 'Content-Type' and 'Authorization' Headers.
        You'll learn a lot about what you need to include for each request in the docs, as well as these tutorials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Parameters can be included in a request in two ways. The first is in the routing URL as suggested above.
        The second is to append a list of parameters to the end of the routing url starting with '/?',
        each split up by '&', using a key/value format of 'key=value', like so,
    </p>
    <pre><code>{baseURL}/{routingURL}/?key=value&key2=value2</code></pre>
    <p>
        It is a common best-practice when working with parameters in your application request to create a parameters
        object, and then append that object to the URL when the request is processed. You will find that many
        frameworks such as AngularJS will handle this for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final component of a RESTful API Request is a request object. A request object, much like params, is
        required in some calls, while unnecessary in others. You will be dealing with request object primarily when
        creating or updating an object on the server, while the exact opposite is true when dealing with retrieving
        or deleting an object. In OrderCloud 3.0, all request objects are sent in JSON Object Notation.
        On the flip side, all return objects will be sent back to the client in the same
        format. You will find that this is one of the greatest attributes of the OrderCloud 3.0 API and RESTful API's
        in general. The data is really easy to use!
    </p>

    <h2>RESTful API Methods</h2>
    <p>
        Every RESTful API has a standard set of Methods that allow you to interact with the data model.
        They all serve a different purpose, but together offer an exhaustive tool-set to interact with the
        server. The Methods used on OrderCloud 3.0 are,
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><code>GET</code></li>
        <li><code>POST</code></li>
        <li><code>PUT</code></li>
        <li><code>PATCH</code></li>
        <li><code>DELETE</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <code>GET</code> is one of the most commonly used Methods, and allows you to do exactly as the name
        suggests. <code>GET</code> is what you will use to access any data objects that are already stored on the
        server. This Method is read-only, meaning you will only be able to access information stored on the
        server, never manipulate it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>POST</code> is also a very commonly used Method in OrderCloud 3.0, and allows you to send new
        objects to be created and stored on the server. With a <code>POST</code> Method call, you must also send an object
        as part of the request, like so,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 85px;" class="readonly-box" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'idle_fingers',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="course.class.leftScripts[0]"></div>
    <p>
        which is where the content of the object you are creating will be located.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>PUT</code> is a utility method in RESTful API's. It allows you to create OR update an object stored on
        the server. With a <code>PUT</code> method call, you must also send an object in the request. If the ID of
        the object is not found on the server, a new object will be created with that ID. If the ID of the object
        is found, a <code>PUT</code> method will update the object with the new object you send in the request.
        Note that if you are using <code>PUT</code> to update a pre-existing object, you must send a full object
        in your request. This means you cannot send it an object with only the updates you wish to make.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>PATCH</code> is similar to a <code>PUT</code> in that it updates a pre-existing object already stored
        on the server. The difference is that with a <code>PATCH</code> method call, you only have to send the changes
        in the request object vs. the entire object. This works great for when you are only updating a small piece of
        the object you are targeting.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>DELETE</code> will remove an entire object from server. You will not have to send an object with a
        <code>DELETE</code> method call, as the information of the target object you are attempting to delete
        will be in the parameters.
    </p>
    <h2>OrderCloud 3.0 Console</h2>
    <p>
        To the right, you will see three different containers. The large container on the left is the OrderCloud 3.0
        Console. This is a fully function HTTP protocol-based console for you to send real API requests, much like
        you would in Google's PostMan or Fiddler. We have set this console up with some additional
        functionality specific to OrderCloud 3.0 to make working with our API easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the bottom right corner, you will see your response console. This is where any response data from your
        API request will end up. It will also be the first place you'll want to look if you run into any errors,
        as the API has robust error messaging functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        And finally, in the upper right hand corner, we have provided you with a console log. This log will show you
        all of your previous calls, and if you select on the eye icon, your console will populate with everything
        you filled in to make that call, including the response.
    </p>
    <p>
        The console is currently disabled, because there are not yet any API Calls you can make without being
        authenticated. However, we have pre-populated the console to give you a taste of what a successful call will
        look like in a <code>GET</code> User call. Once you move on from this class, The OrderCloud 3.0 Console
        will be available to you in every class you take. You have the option to pre-fill the method, url, and
        parameters in every course (change the settings in the upper right hand corner of the console). You will be able
        to make any request you want, in any course, at any time. Additionally, the OrderCloud 3.0 Console is available
        outside of the tutorials in the Dev Center. Feel free to make your way over and play around,
        along with our other helpful Dev Tools.
