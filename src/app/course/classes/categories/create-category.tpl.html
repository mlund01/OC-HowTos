    <h2>Starting To Make Sense</h2>
    <p>
        As you continue to create new objects in the OrderCloud API, you'll notice that it is pretty easy. This is
        due to three reasons. One, it is very standardized, meaning the process to complete an object creation for
        one type of object will be nearly identical (outside of the content) to any other object creation. Two, you are
        only required to provide the details you WANT to provide (outside of required fields). And three, you
        rarely have to worry about mapping relationships to other objects inside objects themselves (outside of Assignments,
        which is where relationships are explicitly defined). You have already heard about all three of these in prior classes,
        but they are important enough to repeat again and again. These rules also apply to other API Requests, as you
        will learn in later courses.

    <h2>Request</h2>
    <p>
        Remember back to the 'Create Product' request location url and you will notice a slight difference in the makeup
        of the location url for 'Create Category' shown below. The 'Create Category' request url includes a
        <code>buyerID</code> after '.../buyers/', which is telling the server that this category is to only be used
        under the specified buyer.
    </p>
    <div style="height: 120px;" class="readonly-box api-setup" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'idle_fingers',
      mode: '',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="course.class.leftScripts[0]"></div>
    <p>
        What this means is that if you have multiple buyers who happen to buy the same products
        under the same category structure, you will need to create two separate categories. The products only need
        to be defined once, but the categories are buyer specific. The reason for this is due
        to how a user gains access to a product. A user only has access to a product if they are assigned to the
        product's assigned category. If a category were allowed to be defined across buyers, you could run into
        issues with a category being wrongly assigned to a buyer, giving them access to a set of products they shouldn't.
        In an world as complex as B2B Ecommerce, this is meant to help you from running into unforeseen mistakes.
