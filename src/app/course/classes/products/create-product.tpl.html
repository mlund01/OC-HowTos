    <h2>Primer: Objects and Assignments</h2>
    <p>
        Before you run off and build a fully functional B2B environment, there are a couple important concepts you
        need to understand. The structure of the OrderCloud 3.0 API was rebuilt to reflect a more modular approach.
        What this means from the perspective of the architecture is that one object
        (buyer, product, order, price schedule, category, etc.) is not directly tied with any other object. There are a
        few specific exceptions to this rule, the biggest being that you will often be required to state which buyer
        you are working with. Beyond these, an object will only ever be connected through what we call "Assignments",
        which is separate from an object itself. You will learn more about assignments and why the API is built this
        way in the following introductory course, "Intro to Assignments". But for now, if you find yourself confused
        as to why you cannot directly give a product a price schedule or a category a product, it is because of this
        separation of concerns.
    </p>
    <h2>Request</h2>
    <p>
        Creating a product is as easy as creating a Buyer, with a few more characteristics available for you to give
        each product an exhaustive amount of detail. But first, here is the protocol information you will need to
        make a 'Create Product' request to the OrderCloud 3.0 API,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 120px;" class="readonly-box" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'idle_fingers',
      mode: '',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="course.class.leftScripts[0]"></div>
    <p>
        Note that this is not an instance of a request where you have to explicitly state what buyer you are working under,
        meaning products can easily be sold across an entire network of buyers, as long as they are under your
        distributor. Now for the request object,
    </p>
    <div style="height: 280px;" class="readonly-box" readonly
         ui-ace="{
      useWrapMode : false,
      theme:'idle_fingers',
      mode: 'json',
      tabSize: '4',
      useSoftTabs: true
    }" ng-model="course.class.leftScripts[1]"></div>
    <p>
        As stated above, the product object is quite verbose and has many characteristics for you to define inside of it.
        Also, note again that there is no <code>PriceSchedule</code> object inside of the product object. That will be defined
        outside of the product and connected with an Assignments request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's go through the important key/values in the 'Create Product' request object, so you have a firm understanding
        of what you need, what you might not need, and how you leverage different properties to make the most out of your
        new product creation.
